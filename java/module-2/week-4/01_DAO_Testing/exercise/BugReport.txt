Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_with_valid_employee_id_returns_list_of_timesheets_for_employee()
Expected output:
2
Actual output:
1
How did you fix this bug?
getTimesheetsByEmployee only returns one result per the if statement. I had to change the if statement to a while loop.

Bug 2

Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByProjectId_with_valid_id_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project()
Expected output:
3
Actual output:
2
How did you fix this bug?
the from statement in the sql inside the getTimeSheetsByProjectID was listing employee_ids when it should have had project_IDs. Had to change the
sql code to have it read "where project_id =?"

Test that demonstrates problem:
createTimesheet_creates_timesheet()
Expected output:
1
Actual output:
5
How did you fix this bug?
The createTimesheet method had it returning getTimesheetById(newID) but it should have just retured
timesheet instead.

Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetById_with_invalid_id_returns_null_timesheet()
Expected output:
null
Actual output:
null
How did you fix this bug?
no matter what the value other than the actual time sheet ID the value is always null
we don't technically need this test.
